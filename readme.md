## What is NodeJS?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side.

## js, mjs and cjs
.js: Standard JavaScript file, can be used for both client-side and server-side code.
.mjs: Indicates a module file in Node.js, used for ES6 modules that use import and export syntax.
.cjs: Indicates a CommonJS module, used for Node.js modules that use require and module.exports.

## Built In , third party & custom packages
## Built-in packages:
These are packages that come with Node.js
such as
http: A core module for creating HTTP servers and clients.
fs: A core module for file system operations.
path: A core module for handling file and directory paths.

## Third-party packages:
These are packages that are not included with Node.js by default.
They can be installed via npm (Node Package Manager).
Examples include:
express: A web framework for Node.js.
mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
cors: A middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords.
jsonwebtoken: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
nodemailer: A module for sending emails.
multer: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
body-parser: A middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
cookie-parser: A middleware for parsing cookies attached to the client request object.
morgan: A middleware for logging HTTP requests.
nodemon: A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server.

## Custom packages:
These are packages that you create for your own application.
For example:
logger: A custom logging utility that formats and outputs logs in a specific way.
auth: A custom authentication module that handles user login and registration.
errorHandler: A custom error handling middleware that formats errors and sends appropriate responses to the client.


## Express JS
## some disadvantage of node js
Node.js will become cumbursome as our application grows.
node js This will make it difficult to manage routes, middleware, and other functionalities. Also, it is not easily maintainable and scalable.

## to over come the disadvantage in node  we use express js 
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a set of tools and utilities that make it easier to handle routing, middleware, and other common tasks.

## MVC Architecture
- MVC is a software application 

## api versioning
- Api versioning is the practice of managing to an API over time. 
- it allows the developers to maintain the application without breaking existing clients.
- url versioning: include the version number in the URL (eg., `/api/v1/resource`).

## 
- URL - uniform resource locator
- URI - uniform resource identifier
